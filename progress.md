## Milestone Log

- **2026-06-09 — Milestone 0** (`v0.0-init`): repo, CLAUDE.md / gemini.md / MILESTONES.md constitutions.
- **2026-06-12 — Milestone 1** (`v0.1-shell`): Claude Code scaffolded Next.js 14.2.35 + lib contract + stub API routes; Antigravity built the dark shell (shadcn, AppShell, MetricGrid, SafeToSpendCard); deployed to Vercel.
- **2026-06-12 — Milestone 2** (`v0.2-n8n-sheets`): Google Sheet created + seeded via temporary n8n helper workflow (scripted in `n8n/deploy-milestone2.js`); Workflow 1 live — webhook → Sheets `batchGet` (all 4 tabs, 1 call) → Code node math → respond. Tested: June metrics income 103,000 / expenses 33,400 / safeToSpend 34,600; FDR maturing in 8 days flagged correctly.
- **2026-06-12 — Provider switch**: DeepSeek → OpenAI everywhere (docs, comments, live workflow sticky note). No architecture change.

## Milestone 3 — DONE (`v0.3-live-data`, 2026-06-12)

- **Claude Code:** `/api/dashboard` proxies the n8n webhook (try/catch, 10s AbortController, 503 on failure). `N8N_DASHBOARD_WEBHOOK_URL` in Vercel Production + `.env.local` locally.
- **Antigravity:** `hooks/useDashboardData.ts` (SWR, 60s polling, keepPreviousData), three-state UX in page.tsx (skeletons on first load / normal / ErrorBanner above stale data on refresh failure, centered banner + retry on first-load failure).
- **Also fixed:** transparent AI Assistant Sheet panel — shadcn token colors (bg-card/bg-popover) were never mapped in tailwind.config.ts on Tailwind v3, so the classes generated no CSS.

## Milestone 4 — DONE (`v0.4-charts`, 2026-06-12)

- Antigravity built SpendingByCategory (horizontal bar, CATEGORY_COLORS + gray fallback), MonthlyTrend (blue/orange 2-line), GoalsProgress (progressPct bars, amber #f59e0b reference line at 80%, domain [0,100]); shared dark chart config, ৳ tooltips, skeletons. Verified against gemini.md spec by Claude Code.

## Next Up — Milestone 5 (`v0.5-transactions`, both agents)

- **Claude Code first:** build n8n Workflow 2 (`transaction-logger`: webhook → validate incl. payee → Sheets append → respond) + real `/api/transactions` proxy + `N8N_TRANSACTION_WEBHOOK_URL` env var (Vercel + .env.local).
- **Then Antigravity:** TransactionForm.tsx (type/category/account dropdowns + payee input + date picker), TransactionList.tsx, useTransactions hook with optimistic UI + rollback.

## Verified 2026-06-12 (end of session)

- End-to-end pipeline confirmed with a real edit: Asim added a ৳48,000 income row to the Sheet → dashboard recalculated income/net/safe-to-spend/balances correctly within the 60s poll. Sheet → n8n → API → SWR all live.
- Sample data note: bKash balance is negative (−5,600) by design of the seed; delete the 2026-06-12 Upwork 48,000 test row in the Sheet to return to baseline numbers (income 103,000).
- **For Milestone 8 (Antigravity):** negative account balances currently render blue with a minus sign in the Accounts placeholder — design system says negatives must be orange (`brand-expense`). Fix when building AccountBalances.tsx.

## Notes / Decisions

- `safeToSpend` = current-month net − total monthly goal contributions (defined in Workflow 1 Code node).
- All financial math lives in the Workflow 1 Code node — the AI never computes numbers.
- n8n public API can't execute manual workflows → one-off jobs run as temporary webhook workflows (create → activate → call → delete).
- Sheet seeded with `valueInputOption: RAW` so dates stay strings; reader still converts date serials defensively.
